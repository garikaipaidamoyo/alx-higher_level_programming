# Python - Inheritance
-  Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
## Benefits of inheritance are: 
-It represents real-world relationships well.
It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure. 
Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance
## Different types of Inheritance:
- Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance. We saw an example above.
- Multiple inheritances: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritances.
